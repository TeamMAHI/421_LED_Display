* By November 12, we were able to use the DangerShield to control the brightness, color, and speed of the information displayed on the Neopixel. We also used the sliders to control the x-, y-, and z-rotation of an image in Processing. 
* For the next two weeks, we want to focus on creating more user-control options with the DangerShield. For the Neopixel, we want to input News headlines using Processing and give the user the option to scroll through different headlines and select the ones they like. For Processing, we want to incorporate more image manipulation, such as zooming in and translation. Instead of doing a cube, we also want to  utilize a more complicated image to show why image manipulation is important.
