#### by John Michael Frullo and Cecilia Brookshier

Code and documents for Team MAHI's final project for BIOE 421

### Brainstorming

We want to use the Adafruit's Flexible 8x32 NeoPixel RGB LED Matrix to display information and images to an audience.
Different ideas for the LED Display are:
* News Headlines (Rice Thresher)
* Music Spectrum (KTRU)
* Time Display
* Weather Display
* Games (Maze, Frogger, Snake, PacMan, Tetris)
* Fun Visuals
* Manipulation of 2D images
